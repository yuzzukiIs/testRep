                        <p>Gyurza occupies a special place among vipers. This is the largest and most dangerous representative of the viper family in the fauna of the former USSR. All members of the family are poisonous, and the gyurza is the most poisonous snake found in Russia. In addition, the gyurza is considered one of the most poisonous snakes in the world.</p>
                        <p>In Latin, gyurza is called Vipera lebetina, which means "coffin viper." In Uzbekistan, it is called kok-ilan (green snake), in Turkmenistan - at-ilan (horse snake). In other countries, the gyurza is called the eastern or Levant viper. And the very name "gyurza" is Azerbaijani. That is what is now rooted in the scientific literature.</p>

                        <p>The motley scorpion is a twilight-night predator that preys on spiders and other invertebrates. It uses a sharp spike located at the end of the abdomen and is equipped with poisonous glands.</p>
                        <p>Like any scorpion, it can sting, but the amount of poison it has is scanty, and because of its modest size, it cannot pierce deeply into human skin. However, the sting can be quite painful, similar to a wasp sting. The maximum that can be is an increase in body temperature. A person stung by a motley scorpion feels pain, itching and burning, and swelling and redness of the skin occur at the site of the bite.</p>
                        <p>The species is distributed from Syria, Turkey and the south of the European part of Russia to Afghanistan, southern Mongolia and northern China.</p>

                        <p>In the name of the spider, the name of the Italian city of Taranto is heard, the inhabitants of which supposedly suffered from spider bites more often than others. There is a legend that doctors of the Middle Ages recommended that patients who wanted to get rid of the consequences of a spider bite should dance the tarantella as long as possible.</p>
                        <p>Tarantulas are amazing because they have eight eyes, with which spiders can see everything that happens around, the viewing angle is 360 degrees.</p>
                        <p>Tarantulas live in burrows up to 50 centimeters deep. To catch prey, they do not weave a web, but lie in wait for insects, attack and paralyze with poison, which has a terrible ability to turn the victim into ... a liquid that spiders drink after a successful hunt.</p>

                        <p>There are 3200 species in the world.</p>
                        <p>Homoptera insects with unusual outgrowths on the chest (combs, spikes, hooks) that camouflage them on plants. Medium size, pronotum with process protruding backwards, anterior upper part of head with frontoclypeus protruding cone-shaped downwards. Various outgrowths are most developed in representatives of the family in southern tropical latitudes, and vice versa, processes are less bizarre in humpbacks of temperate latitudes.</p>

                        <p>The saxaul jay, and especially its Ili subspecies, is rightfully listed in the Red Book of the Kazakh SSR, since even in a relatively small area it does not live everywhere. This bird clearly avoids plains, as well as places with dense saxaul forests. More often it can be found among takyrs and sand dunes, the slopes of which are overgrown with rare saxaul bushes.</p>
                        <p>The specific name of the saxaul jay reflects its close relationship with the saxaul. Only on his trees among the sandy sea of ​​dunes does she arrange her nests. In winter, when the vast expanses of the desert are covered with continuous snow cover, which makes it difficult to obtain food, this tree provides the jay and other wintering birds with a rich harvest in the form of flying seeds, makes it possible to lead a sedentary lifestyle, and not fly away, like migratory birds, to overseas countries. In turn, the jay, feeding on the seeds of saxaul, "let the wind blow" most of them, which means it helps to settle it and fix loose sands.</p>

                        <p>The bite of a sand efa is incredibly dangerous, the mortality rate of people from a bite is about 20%. The lethal dose of poison is about 5 mg. This is not the most poisonous snake in the world, however, according to statistics, every seventh person on Earth who died from a snakebite was bitten by a sand epha. This snake is not at all afraid of people and often crawls into houses, outbuildings and cellars in search of food. There are cases when ephs settled in residential buildings, right under the floor. Efas are very dangerous during the mating period.</p>
                        <p>Sand ephs are very small snakes, the body length of which rarely exceeds 1 meter. On average, efas grow up to 70 centimeters in length.</p>
